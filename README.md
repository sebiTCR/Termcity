# Termcity

Termcity is a terminal based city builder game, that runs almost everywhere... (I think so).

# Building


- First, make sure you have all the tools required for building

    * g++ 
    * git
    * make


- After getting all the required tools, we can finally compile the game (the game will be compiled in the bin folder)
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/sebiTCR/Termcity.git termcity
  cd termcity
  make
  ```

- Run the game
    ```
    cd bin
    ./termcity.o
    ```
